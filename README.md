# ApexCasino - A Web App Project created using Firestore, React, and the Deck of Cards API

## This webapp allows you, yes you, to gamble to your heart's content in multiple games including Blackjack, Craps, Poker, Horse Racing, Roulette, and Slots.

ApexCasino was created as a final project for the CMSI 2021 Web Application Development course that requires an API to be used.

## How do I, the most beautiful user on the planet, access this highly sophisticated casino web app? Also, how should I, yet again the most beautiful user on the planet, use this?

You can do so by running our ApexCasino web app [here!](https://casino-5bfa0.web.app/)
**But wait!** In order to save your score you must log in with a google account that you own and you'll be well on your way to playing and scoring high on the leaderboard.

## I want to tweak your Casino project so I can do my own things with it. So how should I do that?

Wow thanks. You can do that by forking or cloning this project and installing the following on your CLI:
npm router, npm install react custom roulette, npm install react-player --save
