# ApexCasino - A Web App Project created using Firestore, React, and the Deck of Cards API

## This webapp allows you, yes you, to gamble to your heart's content in multiple games including Blackjack, Craps, Poker, Horse Racing, Roulette, and Slots.

### Project Explanation/About Project

Upon clicking on the deployed link below, you will be greeted by the Home Page with a leaderboard displaying the top 5 players' scores along with your, the beautiful user's, score and position. Additionally, you'll have the ability to sign in or sign out below where your score is. There are 6 games that are displayed on the Home Page to choose from below the leaderboard, your score, and signing in/out.

Now an explanation of each game and their game play flow.
Blackjack: A green table is displayed along with LMU inspired chips that you can click on to bet however much your heart desires. The betting amount starts at a dollar and goes up to one thousand dollars, but don't let these chips stop you from betting big. You can bet a custom amount using the chips to bet custom values that range in between the chips or even more than our preset of one thousand dollars. If you're not feeling like betting, or maybe you input the wrong amount, then feel free to clear the amount you want to bet by pressing the clear button below the betting chips. When you're confident that you're ready to bet you can press the done button to begin playing Blackjack. Once you've done that you can press the hit or stand buttons based on what cards are displayed. Then, when the game is over, your winnings or losses will be displayed and the play again button to, you guessed it, play again.

ApexCasino was created as a final project for the CMSI 2021 Web Application Development course that requires authentication, an API, and the web app to be deployed to Firebase.
Now with all that being said, it's time to play!
