# ApexCasino - A Web App Project created using Firestore, React, and the Deck of Cards API

## This webapp allows you, yes you, to gamble to your heart's content in multiple games including Blackjack, Craps, Poker, Horse Racing, Roulette, and Slots.

## Project Explanation/About Project

Upon clicking on the deployed link below, you will be greeted by the Home Page with a leaderboard displaying the top 5 players' scores along with your, the beautiful user's, score and position. Additionally, you'll have the ability to sign in or sign out below where your score is. There are 6 games that are displayed on the Home Page to choose from below the leaderboard, your score, and signing in/out. If you ever run out of cash to spend on betting, the home page will display an LMU ad that you may watch to get one thousand LionBucks added back to your account. With this project, we aim to have users experience the thrill of gambling without the damage it does on the wallet.

ApexCasino was created as a final project for the CMSI 2021 Web Application Development course that requires Google signin/signout authentication, an API, and the web app to be deployed to Firebase/the public web.

## Now an explanation of each game and their game play flow.

# Blackjack: 
A green table is displayed along with LMU inspired chips that you can click on to bet however much your heart desires. The betting amount starts at a LionBuck and goes up to one thousand LionBucks, but don't let these chips stop you from betting big. You can bet a custom amount using the chips to bet custom values that range in between the chips or even more than our preset of one thousand LionBucks. If you're not feeling like betting, or maybe you input the wrong amount, then feel free to clear the amount you want to bet by pressing the clear button below the betting chips. When you're confident that you're ready to bet you can press the done button to begin playing Blackjack. Once you've done that you can press the hit or stand buttons based on what cards are displayed. Then, when the game is over, your winnings or losses will be displayed and the play again button to, you guessed it, play again.

# Craps: 
Clicking on Craps from the Home Page will lead you to play the game of craps. (No, not this kind of crap üí©.) Two dies are displayed and roll once inputting your bet from the several buttons, that you can click on, above the betting chips (edit this part for sure). Again, you may edit your bets to a custom amount, and if you're not happy with the amount press the clear button to clear your bet. Once you're done choosing how you'd like to bet, press the roll button near the die. Upon clicking the roll button, you'll see the die roll (who would've thought, huh?) and your winnings or losses will appear on screen.

# Poker: 
(insert poker explanation here ‚ô†Ô∏è )

# Horse Race: 
Hey, you clicked on Horse Race betting. I guess I ought to explain what is going on on this page. Three horses are waiting, happily, to race at the top left of the screen. Below them, there is a Race button that you may click once you have placed the amount you want to bet below where the betting chips are located. Lastly, but definitely not least, there are buttons on the left hand side that you may choose to bet on a specific horse that matches each button's color. Again, if you don't feel like your betting amount is right, then feel free to clear your bet and start anew. Now are you feeling like you chose the right horse? Click on race and just see those cool horses race across your screen! The winning horse will be displayed and your LionBucks will change based on if you won or lost.

# Roulette: 
Upon ticking on the Roulette button, a spinning roulette wheel will be located on the left hand side and buttons to place your bet as to what the wheel will land on. Hey, remember those betting chips? Well here they are again waiting to be clicked on to your desired amount to bet, and, again, you can clear your bet if you're not comfortable with the amount. Upon the spinning wheel landing on a number, your LionBucks will update.

# Slots: 
Do you feel lucky, punk? Well click on Slots to see if you can win _BIG_! Our LMU inspired slots machine will get you hooked! Guaranteed! (I mean even we got hooked on this game.) Displayed at the center of the screen is the Slots machine that will begin to go roll through some familiar faces that you may or may not recognize. Just below where the slots machine is are two buttons that will increment or decrement the amount you want to bet. When you're done choosing how much you'd like to bet press on the Spin button. Your score will update once the outcome has been determined and your gains/losses will appear on screen below the slot machine. Still feeling lucky punk? You can keep spinning away. (We definitely did.)

Now with all that being said, it's time to play!
